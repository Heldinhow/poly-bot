# Polymarket Merge — Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Agent Runtime (Multica-style)** — Coding agents execute in isolated workdirs with real-time tracking
  - `RuntimeManager` auto-detects installed agent CLIs (Claude Code, OpenCode, Hermes, Codex, Gemini, Pi, Cursor, Kimi, Kiro, OpenClaw)
  - `BackendRegistry` factory allows adding new runtimes dynamically
  - `GenericBackend` base class with configurable CLI parser
  - `ClaudeBackend` and `OpencodeBackend` implementations
  - `ExecutionEnvironment` prepares isolated workdirs with AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, COMMANDS.md, and `.skills/`
  - `AgentRunner` orchestrates the full pipeline: registry → workdir → backend → tracker → result
  - Task lifecycle: `enqueue → claim → start → running → complete/fail`
  - Fallback to legacy agents when runtime fails
- **Execution Tracking** — 100% of agent executions are traceable step-by-step
  - `ExecutionTracker` consumes message streams and persists to DB in real-time
  - `execution_logs` table with status pipeline, timing, result, token usage
  - `execution_steps` table with granular tracking (text, thinking, tool_use, tool_result, error, status)
- **Agent Registry + Classifier** — DB-backed agent selection and market categorization
  - `AgentRegistry` selects agents based on keyword matching in market questions
  - `MarketClassifier` categorizes markets (weather, commodity, sports, esports, politics, crypto, tech)
  - Supports ensemble mode when multiple agents match
- **Circuit Breaker** — Per-runtime resilience (3 consecutive failures → 5min cooldown)
- **Skills System** — Markdown skills injected into agent context
  - `skills` table with CRUD operations
  - `agent_skills` junction table for many-to-many relationships
  - Default skills: `weather_skill.md`, `commodity_skill.md`, `news_search_skill.md`
  - Seed script: `scripts/seed_skills.py`
- **Dashboard — Agents, Skills, Executions tabs**
  - `AgentsPage` — CRUD for agents (name, runtime, model, system prompt, skills)
  - `SkillsPage` — CRUD for skills (name, description, markdown content)
  - `ExecutionsPage` — Monitor agent executions with step-by-step timeline
  - `useAgents`, `useSkills`, `useExecutions` hooks with TanStack Query
- **New API Endpoints**
  - `/api/agents` — CRUD agents
  - `/api/skills` — CRUD skills
  - `/api/executions` — List and detail executions with steps
- **New Database Tables**
  - `agents` — agent configuration
  - `skills` — skill content
  - `agent_skills` — agent-skill relationships
  - `execution_logs` — execution tracking
  - `execution_steps` — granular step tracking
- **ATLAS Dashboard v2** — Modern React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 SPA
  - Vite 6 build system with hot reload
  - React 19 with TypeScript strict mode
  - TanStack Query for auto-refreshing data (5s polling)

  - **JANUS Superinvestor Weights** — Agent weight distribution cards with accuracy and trade counts
  - **Agent Hierarchy** — 4-layer architecture visualization (Macro → Sector → Superinvestor → Decision)
  - **CSV Export** — Download stats and bets as CSV files
  - Enhanced animations: fade-up, scale-in, slide-in-right, pulse-glow, shimmer
  - Noise texture overlay and ambient cyan glow effects
  - Custom scrollbar styling
- **HTTP API Server** (`api.py`) — `aiohttp` dashboard API serving real betting data from PostgreSQL
  - `GET /api/stats` — portfolio statistics (bankroll, ROI, Sharpe, drawdown, etc.)
  - `GET /api/bets/open` — unresolved bets
  - `GET /api/bets/resolved?limit=50` — resolved bets ordered by `resolved_at DESC`
  - `GET /api/bets/timeseries?days=30` — daily bankroll replay for charting
  - `GET /{path:.*}` — static file serving from `frontend/dist/` with SPA fallback
  - CORS enabled for all origins
  - Runs concurrently with the scanner in a background daemon thread
- **`Bet.to_dict()`** — JSON serialization for API responses
- **`Bet.id`** — optional DB primary key exposed on model
- **`api_port`** setting in `config.py` (default 8080)
- **`aiohttp>=3.11.0`** dependency in `requirements.txt`

### Changed

## [2.0.0] — Persistence & Trading Mode

### Added

- **BetRepository** — Repository pattern for all bet CRUD operations
- **TradingModeGate** — Environment-based switching between `paper` and `live` modes
- **Connection pooling** — `psycopg2` pool for efficient DB connections
- **CSV migration script** — One-time `scripts/migrate_csv.py` for legacy data
- **Docker Compose** — `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL 16
- **Documentation** — Complete `/docs` folder with system documentation

### Changed
- **`portfolio.py`** — Refactored to use `BetRepository` instead of CSV
- **`config.py`** — Added `DATABASE_URL`, `TRADING_MODE` settings
